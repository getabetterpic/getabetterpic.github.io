I recently upgraded my phone to the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. This is coming from a Moto X (1st gen.). So far I really like the phone. One of the killer features on this is it is waterproof. I plan on taking it with me to the pool this summer to capture moments with my son. Think underwater video.<br /><br />The phone itself is beautiful, reminiscent of an iPhone 4, with a glass back, metal around the edges (although those are covered in a clear silicone-like plastic with flaps that lift for things like SIM and microSD access).
