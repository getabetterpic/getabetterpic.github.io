So I was reading through the latest issue of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/">Maximum PC</a>&nbsp;and apparently there are <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p4069.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=yamakasi+catleap&amp;_sacat=0">27" monitors</a>&nbsp;shipping from South Korea that use the same panels <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC914LL/A/apple-thunderbolt-display-27-inch?fnode=53">Apple's revered displays</a> use, but at about a third the cost. They run the same 2560x1440 resolution, but have cheaper stands and no on screen display. I just recently bought a new 24" monitor, and as soon as I saw these, I thought "Why didn't I know about this sooner?!?" But then my next thought was "What would I do with a 2560x1440 resolution?" Which led to the age-old geek answer, "I don't know, but I still want one."
