After receiving a cell phone bill for what I felt was an ungodly amount (yes, it included an activation charge, but still), I decided to finally say goodbye to AT&amp;T. My wife and I had been with them for many years, but I was finally looking for something cheaper.<br /><br />I started looking at Straight Talk, and the more I saw, the more I liked. It was difficult to get concrete information on some things, like if you could use your current phone even if it wasn't unlocked. I knew you could "Bring Your Own Phone", but I couldn't find if it needed to be unlocked by AT&amp;T first or not. Finally I decided to take a chance and try it out.<br /><br />I went to Walmart and bought the activation kit. This kit includes the first month's service and three SIM cards (something else I never learned online) for about $60. That's $45 for the service and $15 for the SIM cards. The three SIM cards included were regular sized AT&amp;T and T-Mobile SIMs, and an AT&amp;T micro-SIM.<br /><br />Since I had recently bought an iPhone 5 for Jen while on AT&amp;T, we needed a nano-SIM. (Note: the iPhone you can buy unlocked to use specifically for Straight Talk is apparently a CDMA/Verizon/Sprint iPhone they use to provision on the CDMA networks Straight Talk uses.) So I picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/QQ-Tech%C2%AE-Cutter-Standard-iPhone-Adapters/dp/B009P16FKY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360506269&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nano+sim+cutter" target="_blank">nano-SIM cutter from Amazon</a>&nbsp;and cut the AT&amp;T micro-SIM down to nano-SIM size.<br /><br />I activated the SIM and waited for Jen's iPhone to start saying it had no service on the AT&amp;T SIM. I then stuck the cut Straight Talk SIM in, and she is now running the same phone on the same network, but we should be paying around $25/month less. So my gamble paid off and I answered my question. The Straight Talk SIMs do work in locked AT&amp;T phones. The one limitation (at least with the iPhone) is that MMS and visual voicemail do not work. There is a fix for MMS, but the phone needs to be jailbroken, my next project.
