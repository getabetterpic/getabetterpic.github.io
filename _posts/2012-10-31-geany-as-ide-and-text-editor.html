While using Linux (Ubuntu, specifically) for some programming, I came across an IDE called Geany. For those unfamiliar with the term, IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, usually used to assist programmers in writing code. Although not as full-featured as some other IDEs, Geany is great at what it does. I used it while learning C in Harvard's free CS50 online courses. Just the other day I decided to use it for some light HTML coding, and I must say I was impressed.<br /><br />In Windows I had been using Notepad++, a great Notepad replacement, but kept finding it slightly lacking. The main thing I kept wishing for was an autocomplete feature for brackets. For instance, when coding HTML, if I start, say, a &lt;div&gt; tag, I then have to close it with &lt;/div&gt;. In Geany, as soon as I type the closing bracket on the initial &lt;div&gt; tag, it inserts the &lt;/div&gt; automatically. Then, when I go to type between the two tags, Geany automatically indents for me as well.<br /><br />Thankfully Geany is available on Windows. It utilizes the GTK+ runtime framework, which is available on Windows. I may start using this as my primary text editor.<br /><br /><br />Links:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.geany.org/" target="_blank">Geany</a></li><li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a></li></ul>
