I've been thinking about a couple of things, so I'm putting some of them down here.<br /><br />First, I just recently leased a Nissan Leaf, which is an all-electric car. I've jokingly said that this is a sign of my gadget obsession gone too far. Mostly joking at least. I have really enjoyed it so far though, from the way it drives to just the plain economics of it. And feeling ecologically superior to Prius drivers is a huge plus.<br /><br />One of the things that made me hestitate on getting a Leaf is the fact they are automatics. I've always had manual cars except for a short 6-month stint in an automatic that turned into the most miserable 6 months of my life. But the specific driving characteristics of an electric car make it a non-issue. Let me explain.<br /><br />There are a few things I hate about automatics. First, they never know which gear you want to be in. If you step on the gas, the engine thinks for a bit, then the torque converter does its job, and about 6 seconds after you wanted to shift gears, the car obliges. Yet an electric car has continuous torque throughout the RPM range, so wherever you are, you step on the accelerator and you accelerate. As simple as that.<br /><br />The second thing that drives me crazy about automatics (no pun intended there) is if you are going a certain speed and want to decelerate, the only way to do so is to step on the brakes. In a manual you have much more fine-tuned control over this depending on which gear you are in. If I'm going 60 mph in 3rd gear and let off the accelerator, I get some deceleration without having to switch to the brake. Likewise in the Leaf, if I let off the accelerator, I get some deceleration due to the regenerative braking system kicking in automatically.<br /><br />The final thing that pisses me off whenever I drive an automatic is whenever you are in stop-and-go traffic and you let off the brake from a standstill, the idling engine makes you move forward. Thus you have to constantly stay on the brakes or risk running into the car in front of you. Here the Leaf isn't perfect, in that it does move when you let off the brake, but it doesn't lurch forward like an automatic since it doesn't have a minimum idle speed it has to stay at.<br /><br />Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed this car so far and am looking forward to the next two years driving it.
