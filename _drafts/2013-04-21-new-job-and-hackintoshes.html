I will be starting a new job in a couple of weeks, working for a small web-based software company as a tech support analyst. The plan is to work as a tech support guy for a bit, while also training to become a Rails developer. Apparently they give all new employees MacBooks, so in preparation, I broke out my Hackintosh virtual machine and am running it now. I've got to shut it down though. I forgot how hot it makes my laptop run.
