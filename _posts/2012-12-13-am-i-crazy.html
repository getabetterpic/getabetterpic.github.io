I must be very egotistical/narcissistic/batshit crazy. I've decided I'm going to build the next ERP system that the world is going to use. At my soon-to-be former job, we use Oracle, which a lot of very big companies use. The bad thing about Oracle is you have to have dedicated hardware to run it, and it doesn't always run very smoothly. Upgrading can be a bitch, and sometimes there is so much functionality, you just don't know how to use half of it.<br /><br />So my great grand idea is to build a basic version of that for the web. There are currently other options for this out there, but none of them are quite where I would want them. So I have this grand Idea of building the one the rest of the world would want to use. So excuse me now, the download I was waiting on has finished.
