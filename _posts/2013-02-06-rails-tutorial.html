I have started (and made decent headway) in working through the Rails tutorial at <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">ruby.railstutorial.org</a>. I had gotten familiar with Rails through <a href="http://www.railsforzombies.org/">www.railsforzombies.org</a> and creating my own app, but I felt like I had just a precursory knowledge of what Rails could do. So I buckled down and started walking through the tutorial.<br /><br />While I already knew most of the info in it, one thing that has really helped me is the testing sections. Rails for Zombies does not cover testing, and so the couple of apps that I had worked on had no testing to them. I am seeing the beauty of testing, especially when changing things in the app that may have unforeseen consequences in other parts. Testing really helps identify those areas.<br /><br />Overall the Rail tutorial is a great resource. I may wind up buying the hardcopy book just to have as a reference.<br /><br />One thing I was a little disappointed in is the Turnkey Linux RubyonRails appliance only comes with Ruby 1.8.7, while the tutorial is based on Ruby 1.9.2. There are a few sections I began running into that were not compatible with the older version of Ruby. So I had to set up Ruby on an Ubuntu computer I had laying around. I must say though setup is fairly straightforward and easy. Everything about Ruby seems to be straightforward and easy though. I can't say how much I have enjoyed learning this language.
