It was a scene from family life. Not somethin you see in the movies. It was too tranquil for a movie to capture. My 6 year old son, just the top of his head visible over the desk chair as he played Minecraft. My wife, in the kitchen baking muffins. The scent from the oven warming. Me, sitting in the glider reading a book.
