<p dir="ltr">I walked through a few tutorials on RoR, but anyone who has done any programming knows you don't really "learn" a language until you build your own app and have to do some troubleshooting. So I took a stab at it and created an invoicing app designed with law firms in mind. You can take a stroll through it at <a href="http://invoiceapp.getabetterpic.com">invoiceapp</a><a href="http://invoiceapp.getabetterpic.com">.</a><a href="http://invoiceapp.getabetterpic.com">getabetterpic</a><a href="http://invoiceapp.getabetterpic.com">.</a><a href="http://invoiceapp.getabetterpic.com">com</a> if you care to. Let me know if you have suggestions for usability changes, or any other suggestions for that matter. Also, if it is down, try it again later. I am currently hosting it on a personal machine until I'm ready to spend money on a server to host it. </p>
